## Backtesting Trading Strategies in Python



This report explores the process of backtesting trading strategies using Python. Backtesting is a crucial step in evaluating the performance of trading algorithms before deploying them in live markets. This report provides a detailed overview of a Python script designed to backtest different trading strategies using historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

The project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of multiple trading strategies using historical price data. Here's a breakdown of the key components of the project:

### 1. Data Loading:
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas, and loads historical price data for AAPL from CSV files.

### 2. Strategy Design:
The project involves designing and testing several trading strategies. These strategies are represented as combinations of different machine learning models, including Support Vector Classification ('svc'), XGBoost ('xgboost'), and Logistic Regression ('lr').

### 3. Backtesting:
The heart of the project is the backtesting process. Backtesting involves simulating the execution of trading orders based on the strategies' signals. The script keeps track of the portfolio's performance and cash balance over time.

### 4. Results Storage:
The results of each backtest are stored in a DataFrame called df_results. This DataFrame contains vital information about the performance of each strategy combination, including the final gain and the strategy used.

### 5. Data Generation:
The script manipulates the data using a function called x_y_generator() to prepare it for analysis.

### 6. Results Analysis:
After testing all specified strategy combinations, the script ranks the results by final gain and outputs the best-performing strategy to the console.

### 7. Data Visualization:
The project also includes data visualization by creating DataFrames to store values of the portfolio and cash balance at each time step. These values are saved to CSV files ('port_cash_values.csv') for potential later visualization.

In conclusion, backtesting trading strategies is a critical step in algorithmic trading. This educational report has demonstrated the process of backtesting using a Python script, showcasing how different trading strategies can be tested and evaluated. Understanding this process is essential for traders and developers who seek to develop robust and profitable trading algorithms.
